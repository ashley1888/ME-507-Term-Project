 * 
 *  This website contains all relevant software information concerning our ME 507 Term project the Claw Machine.
 *  At a high level what occurs in our project is that the controller task reads the userâ€™s input position and sends that location to the x and y-motor tasks.
 *  After reading the position, the two x and y-motors actuate and continue to rotate until the encoder indicates that they have reached the correct position, 
 *  to a certain allowable tolerance. Once the correct x and y-positions have been reached, the z-motor activates for a predetermined length of time, descending the gripper. 
 *  When the end effector reaches its destination, the gripper-motor actuates for a different predetermined length of time to close and grasps the object.
 * 
 *  The encoder driver file was supplied by our professor, Dr. Ridgely and its documentation can be found at:
